    "Visual Question Answering (VQA) is the task of answering open-ended questions based on an image. The input to models supporting this task is typically a combination of an image and a question, and the output is an answer expressed in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some noteworthy use case examples for VQA include:\n",
    "- Accessibility applications for visually impaired individuals.\n",
    "- Education: posing questions about visual materials presented in lectures or textbooks. VQA can also be utilized in interactive museum exhibits or historical sites.\n",
    "- Customer service and e-commerce: VQA can enhance user experience by letting users ask questions about products.\n",
    "- Image retrieval: VQA models can be used to retrieve images with specific characteristics. For example, the user can ask “Is there a dog?” to find all images with dogs from a set of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide:\n",
    "1. Fine-tune a classification VQA model, specifically ViLT, on the Graphcore/vqa dataset.\n",
    "2. Use your fine-tuned ViLT for inference.\n",
    "3. Run zero-shot VQA inference with a generative model, like BLIP-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on ViLT versus some recent VQA models: ViLT model incorporates text embeddings into a Vision Transformer (ViT), allowing it to have a minimal design for Vision-and-Language Pre-training (VLP). This model can be used for several downstream tasks. For the VQA task, a classifier head is placed on top (a linear layer on top of the final hidden state of the [CLS] token) and randomly initialized. Visual Question Answering is thus treated as a classification problem. More recent models, such as BLIP, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP, treat VQA as a generative task. Later in this guide we illustrate how to use them for zero-shot VQA inference.\n",
